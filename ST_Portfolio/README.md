# ST_portfolio

Portfolio created as part of a one-week coding course delivered by Sparta Global. The course was offered as part of the highly selective HerCapital programme and aimed to demistify the stigma surrounding women in technology. 

My portfolio demonstrates my skills in HTML and CSS which I have gained during the course. It uses bootstrap 3, google fonts and responsive design.

Overall, the course has encouraged me to explore a field I would have never considered and has given me an insight into front-end development and coding; both of which I am eager to learn more about.
